                                <p>I've been at Nao Medical for a year and a half and have had the opportunity for so much growth both personally and vertically within the company. This is an organization that I've felt investment and encouragement from, all while being surrounded by a team of individuals who push myself and the company to better serve our patients.  I never thought I'd be able to have this much freedom and creativity in a job as a nurse practitioner, but now I am in a role that has accentuated skill sets that go far beyond the clinical world I have long been a part of. I feel valued, and I want to multiply that same feeling amongst my colleagues. </p>
